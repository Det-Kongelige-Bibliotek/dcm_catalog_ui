    <title id="SchW">Johann Adolph Scheibe. A Catalogue of His Works</title>
  </head>

      <h1>Preface</h1>

      <p>The present database is the first ever, descriptive catalogue of Johann Adolph Scheibe's
        production including his musical works – ranging from large-scale cantatas and oratorios to
        sinfonias, chamber music and to communal songs – translations, fiction and satire, studies
        on music theory, and history as well as performance practice.</p>

      <p>The catalogue's point of departure is different from the traditional ones in that it seeks
        to include those musical works which apparently have not survived but for which there is
        clear evidence of having existed, for example represented by the large number of printed
        librettos. The database provides not only new information on Scheibe, the composer,
        translator and educator, but presents also new light on the musical life in Denmark and in
        particular Copenhagen during the eighteenth century.</p>

      <p>The Introduction to each work draws on primary sources in The Royal Library, The Royal
        Archives in Copenhagen as well as other places. Among the secondary sources, the following
