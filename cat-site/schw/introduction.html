      <h3><a name="music">Music</a></h3>

      <p>Although, according to his autobiography, Scheibe had composed more than 400 works by 1739,
        a catalogue presenting the works that have survived in today’s archives and libraries
        worldwide would only reveal a meagre result. A hasty conclusion might be that musical
        activities in Copenhagen during the eighteenth century were nearly non-existent; however,
        focusing merely on the surviving musical material presents a somewhat distorted picture. It
        is important to keep in mind that the largest collection of music, the royal collection, was
        engulfed in flames in 1794 when Christiansborg Palace burnt to the ground. In addition, when
        Scheibe passed away in 1776 many of his private manuscripts were sold, some of them ending
        up in The Royal Library shortly afterwards; the majority, however, were most likely bought
        by private connoisseurs whenever a sale was advertised in the newspapers. Even the later
        Kapellmeister Claus Nielsen Schall (1757–1835) and C.E.F. Weyse (1774–1842) who was court
        composer obtained works in manuscript. Weyse sold some of them on to the music collector,
        Georg Poelchau (1773–1836) in Berlin, while keeping others for himself. By the end of the
        eighteenth century, Scheibe’s music was not popular anymore and he acquired a rather
        negative reputation. Carl Friedrich Cramer wrote in his musical journal, <em>Musik</em>
        (1789), that Scheibe was ‘A man without invention and without taste; full of musical
        scholarship, but was never smiled upon with the genius of music […] His works have, however
        (thanks to the Muses), already been forgotten for a while’. Scheibe’s fame soon vanished and
        he was forgotten.</p>

      <p>Since the royal collection was destroyed in 1794, one is forced to look for information on
        the musical repertoire and for information on Scheibe’s works in eighteenth-century sources
        such as library catalogues, auction catalogues, sales catalogues, newspaper advertisements
        (concerts, sales, announcements), academic journals, court archives regarding orders and
        payments, diaries and biographies. The first point of departure is, of course, his
        autobiography, which he wrote for Mattheson’s <em>Grundlage einer Ehren-Pforte
        </em>(Hamburg, 1740). Unfortunately, the details he provides are often too vague to enable
        an unambiguous identification with any of the surviving works. Scheibe only gives a general
        overview, mentioning for instance around 150 concertos for the flute, 30 for the violin,
        60–70 sinfonias, 150 sacred cantatas as well as 2 Passion oratorios and 1 opera. It is not
        possible to verify his many concertos or sinfonias with those that have survived. Though he
        does not give any further information on the opera, it must be his ‘Artaban’ which he had
        finished in 1738 and was the only opera he had composed before writing his autobiography. If
        he was just as productive while in Denmark, it seems reasonable to assume that he may have
        composed around 1,200 musical works in all.</p>

      <p>During Scheibe’s early years in Copenhagen (1740–48), newspapers were few, and very often
        they contained only brief information concerning new court employees or descriptions of
        major events. Gradually advertisements appeared in the papers or journals, announcing
        concerts performed in the local musical societies and sometimes including the name of the
        composer. During the 1750s, the reports of major official events and court celebrations
        become much more detailed, mentioning ‘Kapellmeister Scheibe’ (a title that was used
        throughout his time in Denmark) though very often they do not include a precise title of the
        work being performed. This information can be collated with that found in The Royal
        Archives, since for each official occasion a detailed script was prepared concerning the
        staging and performance, including not only the placement of the invitees and court
        employees but also a description of the music and in particular the duration of its
        different sections. Each event was described as though it was a theatrical staging of a
        play. Together with the printed librettos, which were given to the audience at the entrance
        or handed out when a ticket was bought, these documents provide us with an intriguing
        insight into the musical aspects of the performances and some knowledge of the lost musical
        material. The material in the archives is vast and sifting through it is time consuming.</p>
      
      <p>An overwhelming number of printed librettos have survived which have been of great
        importance for the verification of musical works, especially cantatas and oratorios. Besides
        giving a precise title of the musical work, the printed librettos often provide surprisingly
        detailed information on the music. Though there is often no clear indication of recitatives
        and arias in terms of headings, the layout and typography reveal that a distinction was
        made, but the division between plain recitativo secco and recitativo accompagnato can seldom
        be determined by merely reading the libretto. A few librettos even describe the
        orchestration. Scheibe’s many extensive introductions to printed musical works, in addition
        to his many articles and books on music theory and aesthetics, are also important sources of
        information, and often include biographical information regarding various events and
        incidents. Most importantly, Scheibe employs his own works as examples in his analyses and
        descriptions, and refers to other now lost compositions. It has been assumed that his second
        opera, ‘Thusnelde’ of 1749, was never composed and that only the libretto which he published
        was finished. However, Scheibe uses an excerpt of the opera in his ‘Abhandlung über das
        Recitativ’ (1764) when explaining the intricacies of recitativo accompagnato, and he also
        mentions that the opera had been revised. In his private copy of the libretto which is
        housed in The Royal Library, Scheibe has emended some errors and added a note on the title
        page indicating that at least the text has been revised (‘Diesen Aufsatz des Gedichtes habe
        ich hernach verworfen, u. ganz umgearbeitet’). The libretto was reviewed by the composer
        Christian Gottfried Krause in 1754. The long and detailed review is rather original: since
        Krause did not have access to the music, he relates the libretto to how a composer might
        approach the opera’s text, setting it to music. Unfortunately, the complete music to
        ‘Thusnelde’ has not survived, but it seems very likely that it existed.</p>
      
      <p>One of the most important catalogues for establishing part of Scheibe’s musical production
        is Breitkopf’s <em>Verzeichniß Musikalischer Werke, allein zur Praxis, sowohl zum Singen,
          als für alle Instrumente, welche nicht durch den Druck bekannt gemacht worden </em>which
        appeared in 1761. The catalogue is a list of house manuscripts from which those interested
        could order manuscript copies. The catalogue gives the name of the composer, title (and with
        vocal music usually the first line) and instrumentation. It includes more than 80 works by
        Scheibe of which most are sacred cantatas performed by Carl Gotthelf Gerlach (1704–1761) in
        Leipzig. It seems that most of these works must have been composed while Scheibe was still
        in Leipzig during his early years; however, there are suggestions in the correspondence
        between Scheibe and his acquaintance Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700–1766) indicating that
        the composer also sent music to Gerlach after his arrival in Copenhagen in 1740. Some of the
        works might therefore have been composed later than 1735 but before the publication of the
        catalogue in 1761. Three years later, Breitkopf issued a new catalogue which included
        instrumental music as well as a few secular and chamber cantatas. Breitkopf provided this
        new catalogue with incipits of the instrumental music for a precise identification of the
        work, in the same way that the title and first line of a cantata identified the vocal work.
        Some of the surviving manuscripts of both the sacred music (cantatas and mass sections) and
        instrumental music prove that the Breitkopf catalogues are quite accurate in their
        descriptions. Yet errors do occur: in a couple of instances, Scheibe is confused with the
        Austrian composer Johann Adam Scheibel (1710–1773). In other cases, the instrumentations
        given in the catalogue do not always agree with that seen in the librettos, and changes
        occur throughout the different editions of the catalogue, often due to the definition of the
        basso continuo. It is also possible that some works are wrongly attributed to Scheibe, just
        as many of the anonymous works might actually turn out to be by Scheibe. Breitkopf’s final
        auction catalogue of 1836, <em>Grosse Musikalien-Auction. Verzeichniss geschriebener und
          gedruckter Musikalien</em>, includes a large number of Scheibe’s musical works, mostly his
        sacred cantatas, though it is evident that quite a few of the works must already have been
        out of stock by 1836 or might even have been discarded before that date. Like those of other
        composers of his time, new musical trends and fashions meant that Scheibe’s works were
        simply not marketable any longer.</p>

      <h3><a name="translations">Translations</a></h3>
      
      <p>When Scheibe was dismissed from court in 1748 with a life-long pension, he and his family,
        consisting of his wife Ilsabe and their son Christian Friedrich, decided to move to
        Sønderborg. Here Scheibe established a music school. In order to supplement his income, he
        started on translating various academic studies as well as fiction. It seems that he might
        have had a special agreement with one publisher in particular: Franz Christian Mumme (active
        1738–56). Scheibe was a fast and efficient translator – sometimes with only a few weeks to
        carry out the project – who went to great lengths to find the proper terms and definitions.
        In the majority of his translations, Scheibe included an extensive introduction explaining
        his working process and problems encountered in the text. It is easy to ascertain that
        Scheibe is the translator of the books; first of all because his name most often is on the
        title page or he has signed the translator’s foreword; secondly, the reviews appearing in
        the literary journals mention his name. One may also find them listed in his
        'Lebensbeschreibung’ of 1759, which was published in the literary journal <em>Fortgesetzte
          Nachrichten</em>. His work as a translator is important for understanding his
        comprehensive intellectual abilities. Scheibe’s introductions to these translations contain
        a wealth of information on his life and time in the southern parts of Denmark, providing an
        important context to merely the musical output.</p>

      </div>
      
      <h3><a name="fiction">Fiction, satire and the biography</a></h3>
      
      <p>There is no doubt that Scheibe had a very sharp pen indeed. This is evident in his
        satirical writings such as the <em>Misogynis </em>(the misogynist or women hater), which was
        so popular that it received three editions, and his political pamphlet <em>Anekdoten eines
          Reisenden Russen</em>, criticising the Danish state and national character. However, he
        also wrote the first biography of his friend Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), professor at the
        university and a famous playwright. The biography not only provides information on Holberg
        but also indirectly on Scheibe.</p>

      <h3><a name="studies">Studies on music theory, composition and performance practice</a></h3>
      
      <p>Scheibe’s writings on music theoretical issues is quite extensive and full of small
        anecdotes and details about his life. Scheibe already felt an urge to write on music theory
        while he was in Leipzig. Around 1735 he finished a treatise, <em>Compendium musices</em>,
        which he seems to have planned for publication. The treatise was copied by the composer
        Christoph Graupner, while another transcript carried out by a professional copyist is now
        located in Leipzig as part of the C.F. Becker collection. At one point, the autograph seems
        to have been in the library of Niels Schiørring, who was a pupil of Scheibe and might have
        obtained it from Scheibe’s heirs. Unfortunately, the fate of this important library is
        unknown. A little known but highly important article on music performance practice appeared
        as 'Schreiben an die Herren Verfasser' (1765). Provoked by an anonymous critique of one of
        his cantatas, composed for the celebration of Crown Prince Christian's confirmation (1765)
        which had been performed at the court, Scheibe wrote a fifty-page long response explaining
        aspects of performance practice, compositional processes and the approach towards setting
        music to a text including extensive analyses of some of his own works. It was around this
        time that Scheibe carried out detailed studies on the relationship between text and music.
        In 1773, the first of four volumes on composition was published (<em>Über die musikalische
          Composition</em>); again, Scheibe includes small details about his time in Hamburg as a
          kind of retrospective view on his life.</p>
      
      <div class="toplink noprint">
        <a href="#top">To top of page</a>
      </div>

      <h3><a name="exclusions">Exclusions or doubtful works</a></h3>

      <p>A few works ascribed to Scheibe have not been included in the present catalogue. It has not
        been possible for instance to verify <em>Musikalische Erquick-Stunden</em>, listed in the
        Breitkopf catalogue of 1763 as being by ‘Johann Adam Scheibe’. Breitkopf’s entry describes
        the work as being a manuscript dated 1729 and thus from his early period in Leipzig;
        however, if Scheibe were the composer it seems likely that he would have mentioned it in his
        autobiography (Mattheson, <em>Grundlage einer Ehren-Pforte</em>, 1740), and ‘Johann Adam’
        suggests rather Scheibel with whom Scheibe is sometimes confused. The work has been lost,
        but further enquiries into the manuscript holdings of libraries might prove that the work
        should be ascribed to Scheibe.</p>

      <p>Scheibe held an extensive correspondence with fellow colleagues and acquaintances in
        Germany of which only a very small part has survived. His letters to Gottsched are available
        in a modern edition; two letters to Georg Philipp Telemann (1681–1767) are located in
        Estonia and have also been published. However, he must also have carried on a correspondence
        with composers such as Heinrich Bokemeyer (1679–1751), Johann Joachim Quantz (1697–1773),
        Carl Heinrich Graun (1701–1759), C.P.E. Bach (1714–1788), and intellectuals such as
        Friedrich von Hagedorn (1708–1754), Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg (1737–1823), Christian
        Felix Weiße (1726–1804) and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724–1803). The letters have not
        been listed in the present work catalogue, but whenever information provided in a letter has
        been used, it is referred to in the Bibliography.</p>

      </div>

      <h2><a name="location">Location of manuscripts</a></h2>

      <p>Although Scheibe spent most of his life in Denmark, many of his works are found in Germany
        in particular. A large collection of works, many of which come from his early years in
        Leipzig, are located in Berlin. This collection, once part of the Breitkopf house
        manuscripts, consists mainly of sacred music. However, among the Breitkopf holdings is also
        instrumental music which must either have been obtained together with the Gerlach material
        or sent directly to the publishers by Scheibe himself and for which he might have received a
        fee. There is clear evidence that Scheibe provided Gerlach with material even when he was
        Kapellmeister in Copenhagen: some Passion music (e.g. SchW B2:304) and cantatas as well as
        perhaps the organ sonatas (SchW A4:Coll.001). Other music collections including several
        works of Scheibe’s are to be found in the Fürstlich zu Bentheim-Tecklenburgische
        Musikbibliothek. The manuscripts were obtained before 1750 when the librarian, Johann Martin
        Doemming (1703–1760), dated the catalogue. Among the few sources outside Germany and Denmark
        is a single cantata in England; a volume of keyboard music by various composers including a
        concerto by Scheibe, collected by Heinrich Nicolaus Gerber (1702–1775) when he studied in
        Leipzig – the manuscript is now in the US. Some copies of Scheibe’s instrumental works are
        located in Sweden and were probably acquired by the local musical societies directly from
        Copenhagen, during the second half of the eighteenth century.</p>

      <h2><a name="organisation">Organisation of the catalogue</a></h2>

      <p>Since establishing a chronological order is not feasible, the works have been listed
        according to genre, though that at times also proves to be difficult (see Table 1). The
        music for strings and harpsichord obligato may in some cases be termed concertos by the
        composer or by the cataloguer of the eighteenth century; Scheibe’s classification is always
        employed here. The sacred cantatas have been divided according to the appropriate event in
        the church year, fixed dates and Passion music, rather than according to title or first
        line; the sinfonias, for instance, have been listed alphabetically according to title
        (sinfonia, symphonia) except for works in numbered series which are listed numerically and
        as collections. The separate works which are not part of a collection are listed first,
        followed by collections: for SchW A1, the thirteen separate concertos (001–013) are listed
        first and then the collection of four (100–103) which is also SchW A1:Coll.001.</p>

      <p>Since Scheibe – as far as we know – did not compose overtures, category A3 is vacant and
        some of the categories only contain a single entry, so the figures of the SchW do not
        indicate the number of works, only their placement within the category.</p>

      <h2><a name="structure">Structure and content of each record</a></h2>

      <p>Each work has been assigned a number consisting of a letter and figures. A collection of
        works such as six sonatas or suites has been defined as six distinct works and hence
        provided with six distinct numbers (e.g. SchW A4:100–A4:105 which are identical to the
        collection SchW A4:Coll.005); however, a collection of character pieces all in the same key
        are defined as one work with several movements (e.g. SchW A4:005). Some collections include
        works by several composers (e.g. SchW A4:006, A4:007). In those cases, Scheibe’s works have
        been extracted from the collection and catalogued, while the composers of the other works in
        the collection have been mentioned in the short Introduction. Each work of a collection has
        a unique SchW designation, and each collection consisting entirely of works by Scheibe
        includes a list of its contents and also has a unique SchW designation. In Breitkopf’s
        auction catalogue of 1836, a collection of trios is listed; as it has been lost, a
        distinction between each work is not possible and so they have only been registered as a
        collection (SchW A4:Coll.007).</p>
      
      <p>The Introduction deals with the work in question, explaining details regarding performance,
        genre, contemporary reviews, and Scheibe’s own remarks concerning the work. The Introduction
        seeks in particular to set the work in a contemporary eighteenth-century context as well as
        within Scheibe’s overall production. All German quotations in the Introduction have been
        translated, and if a cited passage is from a secondary source, the original text is placed
        in the Bibliography together with the reference. Quotations only appearing in the
        Bibliography have not been translated. If the translated quotation is from one of Scheibe’s
        works the original language is not included. A reference is provided and the reader is
        referred to consult the source. Though the titles overall expose a heterogeneous and a
        seemingly inconsistent practice in terms of orthography, they have been retained rather than
        modernised; however, capital letters are changed according to modern convention in the
        language in which the title is given. Cantatas listed in the Breitkopf catalogues do not
        include genre as part of the title since it is part of the catalogue's heading; in these
        instances, however, the genre designation has been added to the title. If the genre appears
        as part of the title, the original orthography has been kept (i.e. 'sinfonia' or
        'symphonia') as has the old key designations (e.g. G<span class="music_symbols">♯</span>: 
        G major and D<span class="music_symbols">♭</span>: D minor).
        Furthermore, the old catalogues of Breitkopf very often use abbreviations and contractions
        in the titles due to lack of space: these have been expanded. Also the old way of indicating
        cardinal numbers – that is, often including a full point (e.g. '1.') has been changed to the
        modern standard writing without full point (e.g. '1'). A few works do not have a title; in
        those cases, a title has been provided (e.g. SchW A4:001, C4:004). If it is a vocal work
        with no main title, the first line is employed as title.</p>
      
      <p>The entry also lists orchestration (forces required), headings of movements, and date of
        work if possible. The definition of the basso continuo part does create problems as it often
        includes not only the keyboard instrument (a harpsichord or an organ) but also a bass string
        player. Scheibe does not clearly indicate in his manuscripts whether the part should be
        interpreted as including the bass string player and/or the bassoon player. The Breitkopf
        catalogues are also rather vague regarding the understanding of the continuo part, and when
        comparing their various editions of the catalogue it is evident they often only indicated
        ‘bc.’ which, in addition to the keyboard instrument, might also include another bass player.
        Thus ‘basso’ (bs.) or ‘basso continuo’ (bc.) might signify a group of players rather than
        one single instrument. Below each incipit, the instrumentation of that section is listed if
        it differs from <em>tutti</em>.</p>

      <p>The music incipit is most often in two parts (melody and bass); in those cases where the
        only surviving evidence of the work is the Breitkopf catalogue including incipits, this has been
        used. Whenever possible, the extent of each movement, that is the number of bars, is also
        noted below the incipit’s bottom stave. For vocal works, for which a libretto but not the
        music has survived, a text incipit is provided. The Source Description includes ink type,
        autograph/non-autograph, extent, size, precise transcription of title page including line
        endings (|) as well as secondary title pages, number of staves and size of rastrum, nesting
        of folios, and paper, wherever possible the watermarks too, if they are relevant for the
        physical description and reveal information on the work’s genesis or its reception history.
        The descriptions have been made as uniform as possible in order to facilitate comparison of
        sources, both internally within each work and externally between different works. Terms
        employed for the description of printed texts and music follow common bibliographical
        conventions.</p>

      <p>The Bibliography lists those sources mentioned in the Introduction or relevant for
        contextualising the work in question; the literature listed is from the eighteenth century.
        Only in very rare cases are modern studies or secondary literature on the works or Scheibe
        included in the Bibliography; readers should consult Répertoire International de Littérature
        Musicale (RILM). If secondary literature has been employed in the Source Description, such
        as reference material regarding watermarks, a short title is given and the reader is
        referred to the Select Bibliography which includes complete references (see also
        Preface).</p>

      <h2><a name="how">How to use the catalogue</a></h2>

      <p>The list of work titles is the catalogue’s primary entry to the records. In a column to the
        left of the titles, it is possible to modify and limit the search results while at the top
        of the list there are different settings as to how the results may be displayed.</p>
      
      <div class="toplink noprint">
        <a href="#top">To top of page</a>
      </div>

      <h3><a name="filtering">Filtering and searching</a></h3>

      <p>On the menu at the left side of the display, the following possibilities to change or limit
        the search in the catalogue are listed:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keywords: free text search (may for example be used for searching places, names, or
          genre keywords). The search is not case sensitive but boolean operators (AND, OR) must be
          upper-case letters. Search terms may be truncated with an asterisk (*).</li>
        <li>Year of composition: the search may be limited to works that are composed in a
          particular period. Searching by year includes all works completed or in progress during
          the desired period.</li>
        <li>Genre: by clicking on a genre designation the search is limited to those works that are
          listed under that particular genre as the work’s primary genre. Other genre designations
          such as 'cantata' may be searched for using the keyword search field.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All search limitations function additively, that is, a simultaneous use of several search
        parameters confines the result further (logically ‘AND’). Each delimiting parameter (filter)
        is shown at the top of the list of search results when the search has been completed. Each
        filter may be removed one at a time by clicking on the symbol at the filter in question,
        thus expanding the search again. Filters may be removed all at once by clicking on the red
        ‘Reset all’ button in the list of filters.</p>
      
      <div class="toplink noprint">
        <a href="#top">To top of page</a>
      </div>

      <h3><a name="displaying">Displaying and sorting of search results</a></h3>
      
      <p>The search result is displayed as a list of work titles. By default, only twenty search
        results are shown at a time. The reader may navigate through the result pages using the
        numbered navigation buttons above the result list. The number of results per page may be
        changed by selecting a different number in the select box above the navigation buttons.</p>

      <p>The sort order of the results may be changed with the other select box next to the
        works-per-page selector. Possible sort orders are SchW number (default), alphabetically by
        title, and chronologically by year of composition. The chronological sorting, however, is
        only a rough approximation. It takes into account only the year in which the composition was
        completed. Undated works to which the majority of Scheibe's belong are listed first.
        Clicking on a work's title opens the detailed view.</p>
