      <p>Niels Wilhelm Gade (1817–1890) was, next to his father-in-law, the composer and organist
        J.P.E. Hartmann (1805–1900), the all-dominating personality in Danish musical life in the
        nineteenth century. From when he as a twenty-four-year old won the Music Society’s
        competition for an overture for orchestra, <i>Nachklänge von Ossian</i>
        <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22768969224753.xml">NWGW 10</a>, his fame grew steadily – not only
        in his native country but also abroad when Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy performed Gade’s
          <i>Symphony No. 1 in C Minor</i>
        <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22771593051443.xml">NWGW 1</a> at a Gewandhaus concert in Leipzig in
        1843. Many of Gade’s works were issued by the famous music publishers in Leipzig, Breitkopf
        &amp; Härtel, and Fr. Kistner. From there they were distributed all over the world so when
        Gade died he had become a world-renowned composer. However, he was also an outstanding
        conductor. Gade was the conductor of the Gewandhaus concerts together with Mendelssohn from
        1844 to 1848 and again during spring 1853. Furthermore, from 1850 until his death he also
        conducted the orchestra of the Music Society in Copenhagen and was guest conductor in
        Germany, the Netherlands and England. Gade was also organist at Garnisonskirke from 1851,
        and from 1858 until his death at Holmens Kirke. Finally, Gade was head of Kjøbenhavns
        Musikkonservatorium together with J.P.E. Hartmann and the royal Kapellmeister, H.S. Paulli,
        from its founding in 1867.</p>
      <p>The catalogue of Niels W. Gade’s works (NWGW) is the fi rst thematic-bibliographic
        catalogue of his complete oeuvre; however, already during Gade’s lifetime and throughout the
        twentieth century several more or less complete work catalogues were prepared:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>J.D. Bondesen, <i>Fortegnelse over N.W. Gades Kompositioner </i>(Copenhagen, 1886), and
          in <i>Musikbladet</i> (1887), pp. 17–20 (up to and including "Holbergina" <a
            class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"

        <li>Dagmar Gade, <i>Niels W. Gade. Optegnelser og Breve </i>(Copenhagen, 1892), pp. i–v, at

      </ul>
      <p>Dan Fog’s catalogue is divided into works with opus numbers (1–64) and works without opus
        numbers (101–177). Most of the entries cover a musical work though they may also refer to a
        collection such as <i>Udvalgte Sange</i>. Since the DF-numbers are often used, they have
        been included in NWGW under the heading, "Identification", on par with NWGW numbers and opus
        numbers.</p>

      <h2><a name="source_material">The source material</a></h2>
      <p>The majority of the source material for Niels W. Gade’s works are located at the Royal
        Danish Library, Copenhagen, primarily as part of the <i>Gade Collection</i>, where it is
        divided into two groups: manuscripts and printed editions which belonged to Gade.<a
          href="#_ftn1" class="abbr ftnref">1<span class="expan">The following section is borrowed
            from Anne Ørbæk Jensen, <i>Musiksamlingerne på Det Kgl. Bibliotek. A guide</i>
            (Copenhagen, 2018), pp. 292–94, with permission by the author. Translation: Peter
            Hauge.</span></a></p>
      <p>The material has been transferred to the library through several submissions. The
        collection of Gade’s personal, printed copies and the large collection of his manuscripts
        arrived in different lots. The fi rst time was already in 1902–03 when Gade’s widow,
        Mathilde, and their son Felix handed over a number of music manuscripts contained in three
        boxes. A comprehensive typewritten list itemises the contents (dated 1 May 1903<a
          href="#_ftn2" class="abbr ftnref">2<span class="expan">KB archive, A9, kapsel 18/1, sag
            nr. 2044. Manuscript Dept.’s accessions register 13 Dec. 1902 and 8 June
          1903.</span></a>) and expresses the family’s wish that the music should be donated to the
        library and that the printed editions may be loaned according to the library’s ordinary
        lending rules – hence the manuscripts could only go to the reading room. Shortly after that
        (June 1903<a href="#_ftn3" class="abbr ftnref">3<span class="expan">KB archive, F7,
            Manuscript Dept.’s accessions register, 1901–23.</span></a>), they were followed by some
        biographical documents, archival material and letters.</p>
      <p>In 1918 the children of Gade, Axel, Felix and Dagmar, donated an additional and extensive
        collection of papers and letters. Of the four groups of "efterladte papirer" (surviving
        papers) the music constitutes the third group. The index card of the Manuscript Department
        points out that the music has in parts been transferred to the Music Department. The
        material does not seem to have been provided with a separate accession number or entry in
        the accessions register in the Music Department. However, the whole collection is listed in
        the register of the Manuscript Department.</p>
      <p>In August 1923, Ms K. Wilhelm Hansen (presumably Jonas Wilhelm Hansen’s wife, Kristine)
        donated fi ve autographs of larger works. In May 1929, Niels W. Gade’s daughter-in-law, Anna
        Christoffersen (1889–1970), who was Axel Gade’s (1860–1921) second wife (married
        Christoffersen in 1925), handed over a series of manuscripts to the library. The manuscripts
        consisted mainly of minor works, typically songs, minor choral pieces, works for piano, unfi
        nished works and some chamber music. All these are registered as a "Supplement" to the large
        Gade Collection.</p>
      <p>During July and August 1932, Holmens Kirke, where Gade had been employed 1858–90, presented
        a number of manuscripts. Besides notebooks including chorales, the lot also contained
        manuscripts for the choral pieces "Paaske" <a class="work_number_reference"
          title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=22875348429475.xml">NWGW 225</a> and "Du
        Kærlighedens ophav" <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22790886858065.xml">NWGW 217</a>. In 1934, the grandson, the
        conductor, music teacher, and organist Niels Rudolph Gade, bequeathed additional archival
        material to the Manuscript Department. In April that same year, the Music Society
        transferred their archive to the library which also included several music manuscripts.
        Furthermore, throughout the time several additional manuscripts have been offered as gifts
        or bought from music antiquarians or at auctions.</p>

      <h2><a name="contents">Contents</a></h2>
      <h3><a name="ms">Manuscripts</a></h3> 
      <p>The large collection (and supplements) of manuscripts contains the vast majority of Gade’s major works:
      the symphonies, other orchestral works, the large concert pieces, the piano and choral works,
      solo songs and chamber music. Many of the other works have been added since, so that the
      collection is now more or less complete. Though it is relatively rare, it is still possible to
      fi nd minor works, album sheets etc. at auctions and owned by private individuals. One of the
      manuscripts that is absent in the collection is the score to the First Symphony; so far the
      collection has only a few folios comprising drafts of the work. A search for the missing
      source has been carried out but so far in vain.</p> 
      <p>In addition to Gade’s own manuscripts, the
      collection also contains a number of works by other composers which Gade had reworked in
      different ways as part of his engagement with the Music Society. Some of these have been
      included in the present catalogue of works: Franz Schubert’s "Hymne" <a class="work_number_reference"
        title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=24649054089731.xml">NWGW B 11</a>; "Mirjams

          title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=24653134439651.xml">NWGW B 06</a>.</p> 
      <h3><a name="print">Printed music</a></h3>
      <p>The collection of printed music contains those
      copies which Gade typically received from publishers and editors of his works. This often
      applies to several different types of material such as scores, instrumental and vocal parts,
      piano scores (two or four hands) with and without text. The collection includes approximately
      230 units, many of which have hardly ever been used.</p>
