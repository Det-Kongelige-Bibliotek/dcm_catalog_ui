      <p>Niels Wilhelm Gade (1817–1890) was, next to his father-in-law, the composer and organist
        J.P.E. Hartmann (1805–1900), the all-dominating personality in Danish musical life in the
        nineteenth century. From when he as a twenty-four-year old won the Music Society’s
        competition for an overture for orchestra, <i>Nachklänge von Ossian</i>
        <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22768969224753.xml">NWGW 10</a>, his fame grew steadily – not only
        in his native country but also abroad when Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy performed Gade’s
          <i>Symphony No. 1 in C Minor</i>
        <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22771593051443.xml">NWGW 1</a> at a Gewandhaus concert in Leipzig in
        1843. Many of Gade’s works were issued by the famous music publishers in Leipzig, Breitkopf
        &amp; Härtel, and Fr. Kistner. From there they were distributed all over the world so when
        Gade died he had become a world-renowned composer. However, he was also an outstanding
        conductor. Gade was the conductor of the Gewandhaus concerts together with Mendelssohn from
        1844 to 1848 and again during spring 1853. Furthermore, from 1850 until his death he also
        conducted the orchestra of the Music Society in Copenhagen and was guest conductor in
        Germany, the Netherlands and England. Gade was also organist at Garnisonskirke from 1851,
        and from 1858 until his death at Holmens Kirke. Finally, Gade was head of Kjøbenhavns
        Musikkonservatorium together with J.P.E. Hartmann and the royal Kapellmeister, H.S. Paulli,
        from its founding in 1867.</p>
      <p>The catalogue of Niels W. Gade’s works (NWGW) is the first thematic-bibliographic catalogue
        of his complete oeuvre; however, already during Gade’s lifetime and throughout the twentieth
        century several more or less complete work catalogues were prepared:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>J.D. Bondesen, <i>Fortegnelse over N.W. Gades Kompositioner </i>(Copenhagen, 1886), and
          in <i>Musikbladet</i> (1887), pp. 17–20 (up to and including "Holbergina" <a
            class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"

      </ul>
      <p>Dan Fog’s catalogue is divided into works with opus numbers (1–64) and works without opus
        numbers (101–177). Most of the entries cover a musical work though they may also refer to a
        collection such as <i>Udvalgte Sange</i>. Since the DF-numbers are often used, they have
        been included in NWGW under the heading, "Identification", on par with NWGW numbers and opus
        numbers.</p>

      <h2><a name="source_material">The source material</a></h2>
      <p>The majority of the source material for Niels W. Gade’s works are located at the Royal
        Danish Library, Copenhagen, primarily as part of the <i>Gade Collection</i>, where it is
        divided into two groups: manuscripts and printed editions which belonged to Gade.<a
          href="#_ftn1" class="abbr ftnref">1<span class="expan">The following section is borrowed
            from Anne Ørbæk Jensen, <i>Musiksamlingerne på Det Kgl. Bibliotek. A guide</i>
            (Copenhagen, 2018), pp. 292–94, with permission by the author. Translation: Peter
            Hauge.</span></a></p>
      <p>The material has been transferred to the library through several submissions. The
        collection of Gade’s personal, printed copies and the large collection of his manuscripts
        arrived in different lots. The first time was already in 1902–03 when Gade’s widow,
        Mathilde, and their son Felix handed over a number of music manuscripts contained in three
        boxes. A comprehensive typewritten list itemises the contents (dated 1 May 1903<a
          href="#_ftn2" class="abbr ftnref">2<span class="expan">KB archive, A9, kapsel 18/1, sag
            nr. 2044. Manuscript Dept.’s accessions register 13 Dec. 1902 and 8 June
          1903.</span></a>) and expresses the family’s wish that the music should be donated to the
        library and that the printed editions may be loaned according to the library’s ordinary
        lending rules – hence the manuscripts could only go to the reading room. Shortly after that
        (June 1903<a href="#_ftn3" class="abbr ftnref">3<span class="expan">KB archive, F7,
            Manuscript Dept.’s accessions register, 1901–23.</span></a>), they were followed by some
        biographical documents, archival material and letters.</p>
      <p>In 1918 the children of Gade, Axel, Felix and Dagmar, donated an additional and extensive
        collection of papers and letters. Of the four groups of "efterladte papirer" (surviving
        papers) the music constitutes the third group. The index card of the Manuscript Department
        points out that the music has in parts been transferred to the Music Department. The
        material does not seem to have been provided with a separate accession number or entry in
        the accessions register in the Music Department. However, the whole collection is listed in
        the register of the Manuscript Department.</p>
      <p>In August 1923, Ms K. Wilhelm Hansen (presumably Jonas Wilhelm Hansen’s wife, Kristine)
        donated five autographs of larger works. In May 1929, Niels W. Gade’s daughter-in-law, Anna
        Christoffersen (1889–1970), who was Axel Gade’s (1860–1921) second wife (married
        Christoffersen in 1925), handed over a series of manuscripts to the library. The manuscripts
        consisted mainly of minor works, typically songs, minor choral pieces, works for piano, unfi
        nished works and some chamber music. All these are registered as a "Supplement" to the large
        Gade Collection.</p>
      <p>During July and August 1932, Holmens Kirke, where Gade had been employed 1858–90, presented
        a number of manuscripts. Besides notebooks including chorales, the lot also contained
        manuscripts for the choral pieces "Paaske" <a class="work_number_reference"
          title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=22875348429475.xml">NWGW 225</a> and "Du
        Kærlighedens ophav" <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22790886858065.xml">NWGW 217</a>. In 1934, the grandson, the
        conductor, music teacher, and organist Niels Rudolph Gade, bequeathed additional archival
        material to the Manuscript Department. In April that same year, the Music Society
        transferred their archive to the library which also included several music manuscripts.
        Furthermore, throughout the time several additional manuscripts have been offered as gifts
        or bought from music antiquarians or at auctions.</p>

      <h2><a name="contents">Contents</a></h2>
      <h3><a name="ms">Manuscripts</a></h3>
      <p>The large collection (and supplements) of manuscripts contains the vast majority of Gade’s
        major works: the symphonies, other orchestral works, the large concert pieces, the piano and
        choral works, solo songs and chamber music. Many of the other works have been added since,
        so that the collection is now more or less complete. Though it is relatively rare, it is
        still possible to find minor works, album sheets etc. at auctions and owned by private
        individuals. One of the manuscripts that is absent in the collection is the score to the
        First Symphony; so far the collection has only a few folios comprising drafts of the work. A
        search for the missing source has been carried out but so far in vain.</p>
      <p>In addition to Gade’s own manuscripts, the collection also contains a number of works by
        other composers which Gade had reworked in different ways as part of his engagement with the
        Music Society. Some of these have been included in the present catalogue of works: Franz
        Schubert’s "Hymne" <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=24649054089731.xml">NWGW B 11</a>; "Mirjams Siegesgesang" <a

      <h3><a name="print">Printed music</a></h3>
      <p>The collection of printed music contains those copies which Gade typically received from
        publishers and editors of his works. This often applies to several different types of
        material such as scores, instrumental and vocal parts, piano scores (two or four hands) with
        and without text. The collection includes approximately 230 units, many of which have hardly
        ever been used.</p> Material in other libraries <p>In Denmark there are also manuscripts of
        Gade’s located in: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The library at The Royal Danish Academy of Music, Copenhagen</li>
        <li>The library at The Music Museum, Copenhagen </li>

      <div class="toplink noprint">
        <a href="#top">To top of page</a>
      </div>
      <p>Due to Gade’s association with Germany in particular, there are also manuscripts in the
        following foreign libraries and institutions:</p>

      <h2><a name="structure">The structure of the entries</a></h2>
      <h3><a name="work">The work concept</a></h3>
      <p>The main catalogue comprises compositions that are complete in structure even though they
        may not necessarily be so in detail. Fragments of compositions which, so far as is known,
        were never completed, and arrangements of other composers’ works have been placed in the
        appendix.</p>
      <p>Songs, choral pieces and instrumental interludes, which are part of a larger work such as
        Morgensang in "Elverskud" <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22781397275393.xml">NWGW 165</a>, the bridal waltz in "Et Folkesagn"
          <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22800758956097.xml">NWGW 159</a>, are not considered independent
        works with an assigned NWGW number.</p>
      <p>Songs and choral pieces that are part of a collection, irrespective of whether the
        collection only includes songs by Gade ("Tre Digte af C. Hauch", <a
          class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22775836368835.xml">NWGW Coll. 10</a>) or whether they were
        published in a broader context with works by other composers ("Samling af fleerstemmige
        Mandssange udgiven af den danske Studenter-Sangforening"), have been registered as
        individual works and assigned a NWGW number as they often were performed separately ("Kong
        Valdemars Jagt", Paa Sjølunds fagre Sletter, <a class="work_number_reference"
          title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=22798044005457.xml">NWGW 300</a>). The
        same principle has been employed for collections of piano pieces. An outline of the
        collection’s contents with an indication of the most important common information has been
        placed in the final parts of the appendix.</p>
      <p>Arrangements of Gade’s compositions have not been defined as independent works and are
        therefore placed under the same NWGW number, typically piano arrangements of orchestral
        works.</p>
      <h3><a name="identification">Identification</a></h3>
      <p>In addition to the NWGW numbers and Opus numbers, those of the Niels W. Gade. Works (GW)
        and the numbers in Dan Fog’s N.W. Gade-Katalog are also given.</p>
      <h3><a name="titles">Work titles</a></h3>
      <p>The title appearing in the first printed edition is employed as main title in the
        catalogue. Thus works that were first published in Germany are listed using the German title
        ("Nachklänge von Ossian", <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22768969224753.xml">NWGW 10</a>). Regarding unpublished works, the
        main title is that of the autograph or, if that has not survived, the transcript (or
        transcripts) that document the work’s existence. All significant titles are reproduced in
        the source’s original language ("Elverskud", <a class="work_number_reference"
          title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=22781397275393.xml">NWGW 165</a>) while
        titles designating a genre are given in standardized form ("Sonate nr. 1 for violin og
        klaver", <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22771598083763.xml">NWGW 31</a>). If an instrumental work does not
        carry any title, the tempo marking ("Allegro molto", NWGW 114), is employed, while the texts
        first line is used for vocal works ("Udrust dig, Helt fra Golgatha", <a
          class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22797949120545.xml">NWGW 224</a>). Works which include incidental
        music are provided with titles such as "Musik til Ludvig Holbergs Skuespil 'Ulysses von
        Ithacia'" <a class="work_number_reference" title="View work details"
          href="document.xq?doc=22789614428083.xml">NWGW 155</a>, as otherwise the titles would
        refer to the play or drama as a whole. In those instances where a work was published with a
        German, English or French text, these are also reproduced. Subtitles are only provided if
        they appear in the sources; new ones have not been created. In those instances where a work
        has been several different variants of the main title – typically if the title in a printed
        edition is different from that of the autograph manuscript ("Nachklänge von Ossian" /
        "Efterklang af Ossian" / "Gjenklang af Ossian", <a class="work_number_reference"
          title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=22768969224753.xml">NWGW 10</a>) – these
        are listed as variant titles. First lines of songs are also given as variant titles.</p>
      
      <h3><a name="instrumentation">Instrumentation and incipits</a></h3>
      <p>If a work appears in different instrumentations, this have been reported under each
        version. The incipits in NWGW comprise the fi rst bars of the composition’s main sections
        (movements, scenes, etc.) with an indication of the work’s or the section’s total number of
        bars. A repeat sign has been omitted in those cases where the passage to be repeated is
        longer than the incipit. Where a vocal work begins with an extended instrumental
        introduction, the introductory bars are included as well as the beginning of the vocal
        passage.</p>

      <h3><a name="sources">Sources</a></h3>
      <p>The list of sources covers only those – manuscripts as well as printed editions – from
        Gade’s own time. If a work was not published until after Gade’s death this has been noted
        with as "posthumous" ("Agnete og Havfruerne", <a class="work_number_reference"
          title="View work details" href="document.xq?doc=22931808904401.xml">NWGW 163</a>). 
        Each source has a descriptive
        heading noting the type of source, for example, "Score, autograph, fair copy". If
        "autograph" is indicated without further explanation, it is Niels W. Gade’s; however,
        another name (e.g. "autograph (G.C. Bohlmann)"), naming the person who carried out the
        instrumentation for Gade, may also be provided. For the dating of foreign printed sources,
        <i>Hofmeister</i><a class="abbr ftnref" title="" href="#_ftn4">4<span class="expan"><span

          style="cursor: pointer">http://www.hofmeister.rhul.ac.uk/2008/index.html</span></span></a> has been consulted, while the dating of Danish editions are based on <i>DF</i>,

      <h3><a name="history">The work’s history</a></h3>
      <p>Information on the work’s history includes a brief summary of the work’s genesis and date, if
      this is known, and a list of performances during Gade’s lifetime as well as a selection of
      reviews. Information on performances has largely been borrowed from Inger Sørensen, Niels W.
      Gade – et dansk verdensnavn, pp. 395–421, augmented by searches in ripm<a class="abbr ftnref" title="" 
        href="#_ftn6">6<span class="expan"><span onclick="location.href='https://www.ripmfulltext.org'" 
          style="cursor: pointer">https://www.ripmfulltext.org</span></span></a> and digitized
      newspapers in Mediestream. However, since the number of digitized newspapers is continuously
      expanding, the listed details are per se only a selection. The dating of the works is based on
      Gade’s own indications in the autograph scores or those copies which he authorized; if these
      have not survived, the date of publication has been employed for those works that were
      printed. Bibliography The bibliography is divided into two parts: documents (letters) and a
      select bibliography arranged in chronological order. The correspondence is divided into
      letters to and from Gade and letters from others that document aspects of the work’s history.
      The select bibliography includes primarily more recent literature and in some cases articles
      which appeared in journals in Gade’s own lifetime. For older literature the reader is referred
      to Sigurd Berg, "Litteratur omkring Niels W. Gade 1843-1950", Dansk Musiktidsskrift, 42
      (1962), pp. 16–18.</p>

        alt="Gade's musical signature"/>Throughout most of his career, Gade signed his works with his
      name written in musical notes. The g-clef precedes the notes while
      the c-clef is notated up-side down at the end of the stave; in that way
      it is also possible to read the same signature – though an octave
      lower – by turning the paper around.</p>
