      <p>The thematic-bibliographic catalogue of Niels W. Gade’s works marks the end of a research project
      that began with the biography <i>Niels W. Gade – et dansk verdensnavn</i> (2002) and was continued with the
      publication of <i>Niels W. Gade og hans europæiske kreds. En brevveksling 1836-1891</i> (2008), vols. 1–3.</p>
      <p>The work was begun following the publication of a similar thematic-bibliographic catalogue of
      J.P.E. Hartmann’s work and the basic principles have been maintained in the present catalogue.</p>
      <p>The initial work carried out by research librarian Anne Ørbæk Jensen, the Royal Danish Library –
      in her capacity as secretary for the Niels W. Gade Edition – has been of great help as well as the music
      antiquarian Dan Fog’s <i>N.W. Gade-katalog. En fortegnelse over Niels W. Gades trykte kompositioner</i> (1986).</p>
      <p>Throughout the whole period, I have enjoyed the privilege of being affi liated with the Danish
      Centre for Music Editing (DCM), at the Royal Danish Library. I wish to thank my colleagues Axel Teich
      Geertinger, Niels Bo Foltmann and Bjarke Moe, and in particular Peter Hauge, Ph.D., who has made an
      extra ordinary contribution with a meticulous and constructive review of the entire manuscript. Warm
      thanks are also due to Iben Brodersen and Jeppe Plum Andersen, the Music and Theatre Collection,
      who provided a "shuttle service" with materials from the copious, closed stacks.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, I wish to thank the foundations that have showed me confi dence by supporting
      the preparation with generous donations: Augustinus Fonden , Beckett-Fonden and Oticon Fonden.</p>
