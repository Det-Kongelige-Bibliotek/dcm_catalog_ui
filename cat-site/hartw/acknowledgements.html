      <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The idea of preparing a thematic-bibliographic catalogue of J.P.E. Hartmann’s works dates back to the mid-1990s, 
        when I started working intensely on the musically gifted Hartmann family. This work led to three publications: 
        a biography, the family’s letters and a work catalogue. The first two books were completed with support from 
        Statens Humanistiske Forskningsråd (the Danish Research Council) during the years 1994–2002. 
        The work on the thematic-bibliographic catalogue was first initiated in 2011, when I received a grant from Augustinus Fonden. 
        This allowed me a half-time reduction in my commitments as research librarian at Danmarks Pædagogiske Bibliotek (Danish Library of Education), 
        so that I was able to transfer to The Royal Library where most of the relevant material is shelved.</p>
      <p>It proved to be the ideal time as the Danish Centre for Music Editing, under whose auspices I was placed, 
        was then preparing the first detailed thematic-bibliographic catalogue in Denmark. 
        The <a href="http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html"><em>Catalogue of Carl Nielsen’s Works</em> (CNW)</a> employed the database system, MerMEId, 
        developed especially for the purpose by DCM, which has aroused international attention.</p>
      <p>I would like to express my warmest thanks to the people behind MerMEId, Dr Axel Teich Geertinger, head of DCM, 
        and IT consultant, Sigfrid Lundberg, who always and willingly listened to my wishes and implemented them; 
        they also helped me whenever there were technical problems I could not solve myself. 
        It has been a privilege to work with the database program while it has been under development.</p>
      <p>Special thanks are due to my good colleagues, Dr Peter Hauge, who has seen through the manuscript with a 
        critical eye on the language, and my old fellow student, Master of Arts Birthe Skou, who took on the task 
        of preparing the nearly 1,200 incipits and approached the assignment with an extraordinary enthusiasm and expertise. 
        Thanks are also due to Iben Brodersen and Jeppe Plum-Andersen of the Music and Theatre Collection, 
        who for the last six years have faithfully fetched vast amounts of material from the library’s closed stacks.</p>
      <p>In addition I send many grateful thoughts to my late friend, the music antiquarian Dr hon. Dan Fog. 
        His catalogue, <em>Hartmann-katalog, fortegnelse over J.P.E. Hartmanns trykte værker </em>(1991), 
        and its corresponding collection, <em>Samling 1</em> of <em>Dan Fogs Samlinger</em>, containing all the 
        registered works in the same order as the catalogue, have been of invaluable service.</p>
      <p>Finally I wish to express my most heartfelt thanks to the great-great-grandchild of J.P.E. Hartmann, 
        the lawyer Denis Waelbroeck, Brussels, who has shown an exceptional interest in my work on his family’s history and music. 
        This book is dedicated to him.</p>
