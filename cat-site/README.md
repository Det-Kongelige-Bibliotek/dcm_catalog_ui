# The software and how it is structured

This is the software.

## Individual web sites

You'll find four example services, only one of which contains data.

| directory  | URI mapping |
|:-----------|:------------|
| cnw        | http://localhost/dcm/cnw/navigation.xq |
| hartw      | http://localhost/dcm/hartw/navigation.xq (empty) |
| nwgw       | http://localhost/dcm/nwgw/navigation.xq (empty) |
| schw       | http://localhost/dcm/schw/navigation.xq (empty) |

These directories contain editorial texts and specific HTML for each edition.

## Misc css, xsl, javascript and tools
