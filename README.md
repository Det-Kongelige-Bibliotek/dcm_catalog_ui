# DCM Catalog UI

This is the end user interface for catalogs created using the [MerMEId cataloging tool](https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/MerMEId).
That is, this is a tool for presenting thematic catalogs of music metadata, based on the the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) XML schema. As of April 2017 both DCM Catalog UI and MerMEId supports MEI 3.0.0.

1. The [Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw/navigation.xq) is implemented using the software distributed here. 
2. DCW Catalogue of the Works of Frederick Delius https://delius.music.ox.ac.uk/catalogue/welcome.html
